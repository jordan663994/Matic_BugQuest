        hello, this is jordan69420 from the gitcoin hackathon, I am writing you to inform you that you groundbreaking cryptocurrency has 
a fatal flaw.There is absoultely nothing in your root contract requiring that the connected conteract on an ethereum network is on the
mainnet. The code that stops novices from exploiting the glich is usless website html, not solitity. There is a quick fix, just make your
network require that the contract on the eth side is on the mainet. BUT YOU NEED TO DO THIS IN YOUR CONTRACT, NOT YOUR WEBSITE.



        sincerely, jordan69420. on behalf of gitcoin hackathons
